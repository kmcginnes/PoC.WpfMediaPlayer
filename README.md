# PoC.WpfMediaPlayer
Proof of Concept for playing video files with WPF's MediaElement

VLC is a beast to work with in WPF. The question is, is there something better? This is an attempt to use WPF's built in video player. It should support playing back any video that Windows Media Player can play. This is not the behavior that I've seen.
